PyUSB-0.1
=========

PyUSB is a Python module that provides easy USB access from Python language.

PyUSB is a libusb wrapper, but this will could not be truth in future versions.

I'm using the Slackware 10.1 distribution for the development and tests.

Currently, PyUSB doesn't make more nothing besides enumerating usb devices.

I'm trying release a usable version quickly, be patient or help.

To compile PyUSB, you need the libusb, available at http://libusb.sourceforge.net
To build PyUSB type this:

python setup.py build

This command will create the usb.so library, copy it to python library path.
