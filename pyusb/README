PyUSB-0.2
=========

PyUSB is a Python module that provides easy USB access from Python
language.

I'm using the Slackware GNU/Linux distribution for the development and tests.

This new release contains basic functions to "talk" with USB devices.
You can get documentation using doc strings, use pydoc to generate a
documentation.

To compile PyUSB, you need the libusb, available at 
http://libusb.sourceforge.net

To install PyUSB, type this:

python setup.py install

This command will install the usb.so library in your Python
distribution library path.

If you have any question about PyUSB, you can contact me at
wander.lairson@gmail.com

Compiling on Windows
====================

I'm not testing PyUSB on Windows yet, but some people has reported problems
trying compiling on it. So, here you can find some instructions to compile
successfully on the Windows.

To run PyUSB on Windows, you need get installed libusb-win32, you can find
libusb for win32 at http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net.

To compile on cygwin, copy the libusb.a file from libusb-win32 lib directory
to $(CYGWINDIR)/usr/lib, and copy the file usb.h from libusb-win32 include
directory to $(CYGWINDIR)/usr/include. After this, run the command:

python setup.py install

To compile on Visual C++, you can use distutils (be attempt, perhaps you need
install some tools to get build, testing on a machine in my job, the
distutils system asked me to install .NET SDK Framework (I had compiled python
with Visual C++ 6.0), my home machine works fine), or you can use the
Visual C++ .NET 2003 project solution included with the package, you need 
the python and libusb-win32 headers and libs in the Visual C++ paths
(or change project settings manually).

USING
=====

You can get a detailed documentation if the PyUSB using pydoc,
simply type:
pydoc usb
and will be generated the PyUSB module documentation...

Here is a short introduction to PyUSB:

import usb	# import usb module

bus = usb.busses()	# get available busses

for b in bus:		# list of the busses
	pass

for dev in bus[0].devices:		# list of the devices in bus
	pass

device = bus[0].devices[0]

for c in device.configurations:	# list of the device configurations
	pass

handle = device.open()	# open the device

conf = device.configurations[0]

for i in conf.interfaces:	# available interfaces
	pass

intf = conf.interfaces[0]

for alt in intf:			# available alternate settings
	pass

altset = intf[0]

handle.setConfiguration(0)
handle.claimInterface(0)

#
# use it
#
handle.bulkWrite(...)
handle.bulkRead(...)

handle.releaseInterface()	# called automatically on __del__
del handle

In samples directory, you can find some examples using PyUSB.

TODO/ROADMAP
============

- String descriptors support
- More tests
- More samples
- Better documentation
- Facility functions to find devices
- Tests on Windows, BSD and darwin
