PyUSB-0.2
=========

PyUSB is a Python module that provides easy USB access from Python language.

PyUSB is a libusb wrapper, but it will be able get its own usb access system.

I'm using the Slackware distribution for the development and tests.

This new release contains basic functions to "talk" with USB devices.
You can get documentation using doc strings, use pydoc to generate a
documentation.

To compile PyUSB, you need the libusb, available at http://libusb.sourceforge.net
To build PyUSB type this:

python setup.py build

This command will create the usb.so library, copy it to python library path.
