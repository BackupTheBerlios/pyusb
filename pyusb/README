PyUSB-0.2
=========

PyUSB is a Python module that provides easy USB access from Python language.

PyUSB is a libusb wrapper, but it will be able get its own usb access system.

I'm using the Slackware distribution for the development and tests.

This new release contains basic functions to "talk" with USB devices.
You can get documentation using doc strings, use pydoc to generate a
documentation.

To compile PyUSB, you need the libusb, available at 
http://libusb.sourceforge.net
To build PyUSB type this:

python setup.py build

This command will create the usb.so library, copy it to python library path.

If you have any question about PyUSB, you can contact me at

Compiling on Windows
====================

I'm not testing PyUSB on Windows yet, but some people has reported problems
trying compiling on it. So, here you can find some instructions to compile
successfully on the Windows.

To run PyUSB on Windows, you need get installed libusb-win32, you can find
libusb for win32 at http://libusb-win32.sourceforge.net.

To compile on cygwin, copy the libusb.a file from libusb-win32 lib directory
to $(CYGWINDIR)/usr/lib, and copy the file usb.h from libusb-win32 include
directory to $(CYGWINDIR)/usr/include. After this, run the command:

python setup.py build

To compile on Visual C++, you can use distutils (be attempt, perhaps you need
install some tools to get build, testing on a machine in my job, the
distutils system asked me to install .NET SDK Framework (I had compiled python
with Visual C++ 6.0)), or you can use the Visual C++ .NET 2003 project solution
included with the package, you need the python and libusb-win32 headers and
libs in the Visual C++ paths (or change project settings manually).
